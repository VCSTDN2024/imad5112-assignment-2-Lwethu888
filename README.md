## Project Overview
The **Maths Quiz** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the IMAD module. This application was created using the programming language **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to improve problem-solving skills.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app helps evaluate mathematical abilities, strengthen problem-solving abilities and builds logical thinking. It also provides an opportunity for practice and deeper understanding of math concepts.

### Key Features:
-  Allows users to answer whether the statement is correct or incorrect.
-  Provides space for users to select their answer. 
- Displays maths problem in a true or false.
- Review page where the user gets to see the questions they got wrong 
 
The aim is to improve comprehension, involvement, and knowledge retention in math quizzes.

## Design Consideration
The design of the **Math Quiz** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an instinctive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is simple, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions
This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled safe coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project honor.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. 

This includes:
- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app is functional.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for the apps distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.
The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push any changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

- This section educates students on why they should understand GitHub version control and automation (GitHub Actions). It shows how they’re adopting industry-standard practices, which is useful for both academic purposes and career development.

## Challenges and Learnings
During the development of this project, I encountered a few challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: I had issues with identifying and resolving erros. 
   - **Solution**:  I asked a developer for assisstance.
   
2. **Challenge 2**: I had issues with running the app.
   - **Solution**: I went to YouTube and searched another way of running the app.
From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.

## Future Enhancements
While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:
1. **Feature 1**: User can set up learning goals and receive personalised quize. 
2. **Feature 2**: Instead of just providing answers, the app can guide the user through problem solving methods.
3. **Feature 3**: An Ai helper that provides immediate explaination.

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for the end-user
